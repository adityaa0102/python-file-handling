A blue NOOB, green behind the ears, went to Pythonia.
She wanted to visit the famous wise green PROO.
She wanted to ask her about the white way to avoid the black.
The bright path to program in a yellow, green, or blue style.
The green Python turned red, when she addressed her.
The NOOB turned yellow in turn.
After a long but not endless loop, the wise Python uttered: 
"The rainbow!"
